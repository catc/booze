# Booze
Why recreate the LCBO website?
1. it lacks an extremely useful feature; actually displaying store inventories on a map (instead it just provides a list of stores)
2. add the option to save to favourites and create wishlists
3. learn + play around with typescript

## TODO

### Features
- search pagination
- save/wishlist
- style
	- add icons
	- make responsive
- 404 / catch all route

### Other
